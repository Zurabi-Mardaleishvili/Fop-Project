# Fop-Project
Our project was to do golang interpreter. we had to write java code which would receive golang code as String and interpret it to java. we were given 10 algorithms.
first we wrote golang codes for given problems and then wrote java code to execute golang codes.
Members of our team are:
Zura mardaleishvili
Giorgi phonadze
Otar dograshvili
Luka megrelishvili
Main base of code was written together. all 4 of us participated. we were sitting side by side and thinking.
our roles were distributed like this:
Otar: writing golang codes for given algorithms(also changing syntax of them little bit to be readable for our code)
Zura and Giorgi: writing java code to execute all golang codes
Luka: testing golang codes in java interpreter and fixing minor issues
